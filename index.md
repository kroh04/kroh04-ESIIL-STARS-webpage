<!--About Me-->
<p> Hello, My name is Kaiea and I am an Advanced Intern for the 2023 cohort.
  I am studying Geospatial Science and Technical Writing at MSU Denver and will be graduating in the Fall.
  I enjoy studying remote sensing and exploring social justice and using my knowledge of GIS to facilitate my understanding.
  In my spare time, I enjoy learning new dance styles, my latest obsession is cumbia.  I love being outside and traveling with my son. Last year we visited Belize. I am looking forward to seeing what all the groups develop with these fantasic skills.
